   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aronprins/chat-app-ui.git
   cd chat-app-ui
   ```

2. Open the application:
   You can either:
   - Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser
   - Use a local server (for best experience):
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js
     npx serve
     ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port your server uses)

The application is purely frontend-based with no external dependencies or frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## üìù Adding API Integration

This project currently uses simulated AI responses. To integrate with real AI APIs:

1. Modify the `sendMessage` function to call your preferred AI API
2. Add API keys in the settings panel
3. Implement proper authentication and request handling

Example API endpoints:
- Anthropic Claude: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
- OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
